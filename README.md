Survey to see what your real-life D&D character would be. Built using Vue 2 and Tailwind CSS.

## Credits
Thank you to the following people/websites for providing resources to help make this project 
possible.

* [u/morepurplemorebetter](https://www.reddit.com/user/morepurplemorebetter/) - Thank you for 
   providing the awesome SVG icons used for the classes.
* http://easydamus.com - Thank you for the original idea, and the questions and calculations behind
  the results. The questions and score calculations have not changed, I simply made this because I 
  like building things, and I wanted to make the survey more mobile friendly.
